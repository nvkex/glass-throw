# GlassThrow
Annoyed by the signup/login popups when you\'re just checking reviews on glassdoor? 
Worry not my friend, I am here to save you!

#### But what are you?
How nice of you to ask. I am just a lightweight browser extension.

#### How do I use you?
It\'s fairly easy. Follow the steps:
- Install the extension.
- Open the glassdoor page.
- Open a random/new tab
- Now switch to the tab where you opened glassdoor page.

#### What do you actually do behind the scenes?
You can read the code in ```foreground.js``` file or if you\'re too lazy I\'ll summerize.
I hide the popup if present and show the full contents of the page. That\'s all.

#### Limitations/Bugs?
Oh, the sad part. You have to switch between tabs, once the page loads, for me to work. Don\'t worry, I am working on it to fix this.

#### Suggestions?
Remember to switch tabs if I don\'t work.
